# Docker Applications Manager
Docker Applications Manager (DAM) allows the user to manage docker images on the system
as apt manages deb-packages in Ubuntu.

At the moment, only one main function is implemented - 
the search for docker images and their versions (branch 0.0.x).

## System requirements
### Building
- Go v1.14.2 or GNU Make 4.1
### Using
- OS Linux (Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS)
- Docker Engine API version v1.40

## License
DAM is under the Apache 2.0 license. See the LICENSE file for details.
